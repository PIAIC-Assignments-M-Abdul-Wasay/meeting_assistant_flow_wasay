## About the Project

The CrewAI Meeting Assistant leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI to streamline the often-tedious process of post-meeting task management.  By analyzing conversational meeting notes, the system intelligently extracts key action items.  These items are then automatically transformed into Trello cards, ensuring that no task is overlooked.  Real-time Slack notifications keep the team informed and promote accountability.  The project is built on the CrewAI framework, allowing for flexible customization of agent roles and responsibilities. It aims to improve team productivity by automating the administrative overhead of meeting follow-up. The user will manually add the members to Trello. After that, the user must verify that the member's full names and initials align with their Trello account names.
